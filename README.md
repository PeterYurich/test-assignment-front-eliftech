To run the app on localhost:
1) install npm-packages with command "npm install" in terminal
2) then type "npm start"

P.S. I've done an additional page "Order History", but I haven't had enough time to mark up list visualization (now there are ids are shown).
So I decided to send it you to see how it works in the test assignment without the visualization.

P.P.S. The Render free hosting falls asleep after 15 min so the first request to the backend is very long. But it works! Just wait!
